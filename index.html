    <h1>Citrus</h1>
    <h2>Lemon</h2>
    <p>Lemons (Citrus limon) are a species of small evergreen trees in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to South Asia, primarily Northeast India. The fruit is widely known for its tart, acidic flavor, which makes it a key ingredient in many culinary dishes and beverages.
     Lemons are also rich in vitamin C, an essential nutrient, and are often used for their juice, peel, and zest, in both sweet and savory recipes. Beyond cooking, lemon juice is used for cleaning, as a natural preservative, and in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, including aiding digestion and boosting the immune system.
